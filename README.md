- **Nix and NixOS**: I'm really passionate about Nix, a purely functional package manager and a language that allows for reproducible and declarative configurations. My favorite Linux distro is [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), which is built on top of Nix. My daily driver is a Mac Mini M1 that's managed with [Nix-Darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin), and my laptop is running NixOS.

## ðŸ’» My favorite language

![.Net](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=.net&logoColor=white)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

- **C#**: C# is the language that essentially bootstrapped me into programming. Back in the summer of **2022**, I started working on a Discord bot in C# while my friend was building the API for it using ASP.NET. Over the next few months, I started learning programming at a really quick pace and quickly started loving the language, as I was able to do things that were useful to me right from the start while still maintaining good performance and customizability. Later on I started experimenting with ASP.NET which I quickly began to love too as I was able to leverage my knowledge from building the Discord Bot into making API's.
