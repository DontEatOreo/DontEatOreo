- I also really enjoy Markdown and LaTeX, which, in my opinion, are the best markup languages for writing things down.

- Markdown is really awesome for writing down stuff like notes or simple READMEs, or really anything that doesn't need any fancy formatting and has the easiest syntax ever.
  - I mainly use it to write README's on GitHub.

- LaTeX is one of the most powerful markup languages I've seen, and it's the industry standard for writing papers related to science or math. Apart from professional use, it's a really good language for creating well-made documents.
  - I used it to write courseworks for my university, and it's awesome.
