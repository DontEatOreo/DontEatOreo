- I first encountered Linux around 2015[^1]. I was intrigued by it and started watching YouTube videos about Linux and Linux Distros, and then decided to experiment with Linux. I started by flashing Linux Mint onto a USB stick and installing random programs and just messing around overall. Later, I created virtual machines with all kinds of Linux distros. Once I got more comfy with Linux, I learned how to dual boot Linux and Windows and kept switching and experimenting between them.

## **2019 - Mid 2022**

- 2019 and onward was when I really started deep diving into Linux before that I only use Linux mostly every now and then even though I was pretty interested in I was mostly focused on gaming back then. Now 2019 was really important year for Linux as around this time [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) started getting momentum and they were more and more games available to play on Linux which game me a lot of incentive to start using Linux more and more as previously most games didn't work on Linux and back then I was spending big chunk of my time gaming so Linux while interesting had very little incentives to invest time, with Proton this changed and I started to embrace and learn linux more and more.

## **Late 2022 - Now**

- Late 2022 was pretty another important checkpoint for me as this was the time I got introduce to Nix & NixOS by my friend at first I wasn't very impressed and didn't really thought of it much and even found it a bit meh but I started giving it another shot in 2023 and then I started actually enjoy it and kind of "cured" my distro hopping as NixOS offers every package under the sun as well it's very customizable.

## üçé My Hackintosh & Mac Journey

### Hackintosh

### **2016**

- My Hackintosh journey and experience was short but nevertheless very interesting and, most importantly, fun. I initially learned and tried to attempt it back in 2016, but at the time, I had both an AMD CPU and AMD GPU, which was an impossible combo. So, I kind of gave up on it for a while. My first macOS version was Sierra.

### **Mid-2017**

- Later, I returned in **mid-2017**, and this time there was this cool project called [AMD OS X](https://github.com/AMD-OSX) which unlocked the doors to using macOS on my PC back then.

### **2019**

- In **2019**, I returned to Hackintosh with the same hardware but a new twist, which was [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg). OpenCore was essentially the new and popular bootloader for macOS at the time and is now the standard, being much more secure and reliable than [Clover](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader).

### **2022**

- In **2022**, this was essentially the last year I would use Hackintosh. At the time, I bought a second-hand ThinkPad T450s for my parents to replace their old laptop. Before I gave it to them, I was experimenting with it by installing a Hackintosh and messing around. Surprisingly, the laptop was really compatible with macOS. I was able to use the WiFi, Bluetooth, and even track battery percentage. A big part of the reason for that was that the Hackintosh scene at that time was very rich, and doing Hackintosh was easier than ever thanks to OpenCore and the open-source community, which helped with tools and drivers.

### Real Mac

- In **Early 2022** I bought my third Apple hardware ever which was the Mac Mini M1 which I still use to this day and it's my primary machine to this day. Since then I've learned a lot more about macOS and now manage it with [Nix-Darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) as well.
