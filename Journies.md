## **2015 - 2018**

- I first encountered Linux around 2015[^1]. I was intrigued by it and started
watching YouTube videos about Linux and Linux Distros, and then decided to
experiment with Linux. I started by flashing Linux Mint onto a USB stick,
installing random programs, and just messing around. Later, I created virtual
machines with all kinds of Linux distros. Once I got more comfy with Linux, I
learned how to dual boot Linux and Windows and kept switching and experimenting
between them.

## **2019 - Mid 2022**

- 2019 and onward was when I *really* started deep diving into Linux.
Before that, I only used Linux mostly every now and then, even though
I was pretty interested. I was mostly focused on gaming back then.
Now, 2019 was a really important year for Linux as around this time
[Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) started gaining momentum, and
there were more and more games available to play on Linux, which gave me a lot
of incentive to start using Linux more. Previously, most games didn't work on
Linux, and back then, I was spending a big chunk of my time gaming. So, Linux,
while interesting, had very little incentive to invest time. With Proton, this
changed, and I started to embrace and learn Linux more and more.

## **Late 2022 - Now**

- Late 2022 was another important checkpoint for me as this was the time I got
introduced to Nix & NixOS by my friend. At first, I wasn't very impressed and
didn't really think much of it. I even found it a bit meh, but I started giving
it another shot in 2023. Then I started actually enjoying it and kind of "cured"
my distro hopping, as NixOS offers every package under the sun and is highly
customizable.

## üçé My Hackintosh & Mac Journey

### Hackintosh

### **2016**

- My Hackintosh journey was short, but nonetheless, it was very interesting and
fun. I initially learned and attempted it back in 2016, but at the time, I had
both an AMD CPU and AMD GPU, which was an impossible combo. So, I kind of gave
up on it for a while. My first macOS version was Sierra.

### **Mid-2017**

- Later, I returned in **mid-2017**, and this time there was this cool project
called [AMD OS X](https://github.com/AMD-OSX) which unlocked the doors to using
macOS on my PC back then.

### **2019**

- In **2019**, I returned to Hackintosh with the same hardware but a new
twist, which was [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).
OpenCore was essentially the new and popular bootloader for macOS at the
time and is now the standard, being much more secure and reliable than
[Clover](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader).

### **2022**

- **2022** was essentially the last year I used a Hackintosh. At that time, I
bought a second-hand ThinkPad T450s for my parents to replace their old laptop.
Before I handed it over to them, I was experimenting with Hackintosh on it.
Surprisingly, the laptop was extremely compatible with macOS. I managed to get
the WiFi, Bluetooth, and even the battery percentage tracking to work properly.
The reason for this was the rich Hackintosh scene during that period. Thanks to
OpenCore and the open-source community, setting up a Hackintosh was easier than
ever due to the ready availability of tools and drivers.

### Real Mac

- In **early 2022**, I bought my third Apple hardware, a Mac Mini M1, which I
still use as my primary machine. Since then I've learned a lot more about macOS
and now manage it with [Nix-Darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) as well.
